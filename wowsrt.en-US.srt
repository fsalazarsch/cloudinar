right?

8
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,299
I gotta say I'm incredibly excited to be a 
part of a firm. I mean the clients you have or

9
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,400
absolutely talk to clients. Your only responsibility is to 
put meat on the table.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,900
You got a girlfriend. I'm married. I have no 
wife or name's Teresa to Cuts here. Congratulations. Thank you. Think

11
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:42,099
about Teresa name of the game move the money 
from your clients pocket into your pocket. Right? But if you

12
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:47,500
can make a clients money at the same time, 
it's advantageous. Everyone them. Correct? No.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,799
number one rule of Wall Street

14
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,799
Nobody I don't care if you're Warren Buffett, or 
if you Jimmy Buffett, nobody knows if the stock is going

15
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,000
to go up down sideways or in fucking circles 
at least of all stockbrokers is all the fugazi in order

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,099
for guys is fugazi. It's a fake if you 
forgot see it's a wise idea to lose your tooth fairy

17
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,800
dust. It doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is 
no matter it's not on the elemental chart it it's not

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
fucking real Stay With Me.

19
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,900
We don't create shit. We don't build anything. No, 
so if you got a client who bought stock at 8

20
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,000
and it now sits at 16 and he's all 
fucking happy. He wants to cash in liquidate take his fucking

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,400
money at run home. You don't let him do 
that because that would make it real, right? No. What do

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:47,500
you do you get another brilliant idea especially idea 
another situation another stock to reinvest his earnings and then te

23
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,400
and he will every single time because they're fucking 
addicted.

24
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,699
You just keep doing this again and again and 
again meanwhile.

25
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,500
He thinks he's getting shit Rich, which he is 
on paper. But you and me the Brokers. We're taking home

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,199

That's incredible serum. Can't tell you how excited I 
am. You should be it's two keys to success in the

28
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,599
broker business. First of all.

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,699
You gotta stay relaxed. Yeah, you jerk-off.

But do I jerk off? Yeah. Yeah jerk off 
here. Let me times a week.

Like 3/4 3/4 times me pump those numbers out. 
There's a rookie numbers in this racket. I myself I jerk

32
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:46,800
off at least twice a day. Wow, once in 
the morning right after a workout and then once right after

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,500
lunch, really, okay, I want to that's not why 
I do it I do it because I fucking need to

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,900
think about your dealing with numbers all day long 
decimal points high frequencies Nang bang bang fucking digits ticket or

35
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,500
very acidic above the shoulders mustard shit can tweak 
some people out right? You got to feed the geese to

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,899
keep the blood flowing. I keep the Rhythm below 
the belt done. This is not a tip. This is a

37
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:23,699
prescription. Trust me. If you don't you will fall 
out of balance split your differential and tip the fuck over

38
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,600
or worse yet.

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,500
I've seen this happen implode. I don't want to 
implode certain know you don't I'm in it for the long

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,199
run, you know. Yeah implosions are ugly. Yeah, pop 
off to the bathroom work one at any time you can

41
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,600
and when you get really good at it, you'll 
fucking be stroking it. You'll be thinking about money.

42
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Second key to success in this racket. Is this 
little baby right here? It's called cocaine, right? It will keep

43
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,800
you sharp between the ears. They'll also help your 
fingers dial faster. And guess what? That's good for me. Yes,

45
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:07,100
Revolutions you follow revolutions keep the clients on the 
ferris wheel and I goes the Park is open 24/7 365
